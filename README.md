# IPMS - InterPlanetary Monetary System

Home for InterPlanetary Monetary System website.

## Motivation

Bitcoin should be considered an Interplanetary Monetary System because
of all premises behind it. It CAN be used as a currency through all
Solar System and beyond.

This line of thought made me realize we should have a home page for it
in several Earth languages, but in special alien languages, invented by
humans or not, so beans from other planets can also know that earth, as
an advanced planet, already accepts Bitcoin.
